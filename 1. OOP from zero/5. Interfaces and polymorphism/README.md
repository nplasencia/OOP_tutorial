# Notes of this lesson

## Interface

An _interface_ allows you to specify a set of function signatures and hide the implementation of those functions in an "implementing" class. Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world.

If a class implements an interface, then all methods defined by that interface must be implemented.

An interface can't be instantiated.

#### Â· Difference between an abstract class and a interface

An abstract class is something between a class and an interface. It contains a contract (abstract methods that have to be implemented by the son class) but it has also concrete methods implemented.

## Polymorphism

Many instances of the same class but, for any reason, they are different between them. In our lesson, we can have a lot of objects of class Soldier but they can be different depending of what type of armor has each one.
